            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>The “Freedom Project” for SEP10 is all about creating innovations that will help us in the future for certain topics. This project allows us to work on our creativity & help share ideas that we may have to better the hardware or software of a subject. The purpose of this blog is to show the way of how I have grown/discovered new things & to show the problems I have faced along the way.</p>
            <h3>Content</h3>
            <p>For my project, I am making a website about mental health using HTML, CSS, Aframe and Github. Using Aframe I was able to make a design for my future innovation. It is an informative website that will allow each person to grow their knowledge on mental health. With this website people might be able to connect since they might be using some of the apps mentioned or may be interested in looking for a new way to help with their Mental health. It may also help economically by helping the readers compare the pricing of the hardwares, softwares & my future innovation. It would also make a big difference in the Global category because this product can be beneficial to health care & the well being of humans.</p>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>There are many takeaways that I have from this project & its process. For example one main take away I got is to make the information straightforward & easy to understand. I've learned that the best way to share information is to gather as much knowledge as possible & summarize it while still getting your point across. Another take away is that I have to be patient & look for help. Even tho trying to look for an answer on your own is good, asking others may be an easier way of learning & less time consuming. I also learned to stick to a plan & focus on time management. I noticed that when I finished every assignment on time it was beneficial since I was able to get more feedback on what I could do to better my website. Overall this project taught me many things & I will be using what I learned later on in SEP.</p>
